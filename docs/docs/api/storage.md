## Storage SPI

Module: `pinion.storage`

Implement the protocol to plug in a custom backend (e.g., Redis, DB):

```python
class Storage(Protocol):
    def enqueue(self, job: Job) -> None: ...
    def dequeue(self, timeout: float | None = None) -> Job | None: ...
    def mark_done(self, job: Job) -> None: ...
    def mark_failed(self, job: Job, exc: Exception) -> None: ...
    def size(self) -> int: ...
    def heartbeat(self, job: Job) -> None: ...
    def reap_stale(self, visibility_timeout: float) -> int: ...
    def dead_letter(self, job: Job, exc: Exception) -> None: ...
```

Guidelines:

- `dequeue` should block until timeout or a job is available, mark job `RUNNING`, increment `attempts`, and return it.
- `heartbeat` records liveness for the current `RUNNING` job.
- `reap_stale` should re-enqueue jobs that have exceeded `visibility_timeout` since last heartbeat.
- `dead_letter` should persist final failures for inspection and replay.
